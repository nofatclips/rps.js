Well, so I wanted to make my own JavaScript framework, but I wanted it to be about unique: was there anything around that didn't have its won dedicated bunch of JavaScript frameworks already available. Yes. Rock Paper Scissors!

It's not finished, in fact it's not even actually working, and I think I'm going to change the API.
But feel free to fiddle around with the code as you like.
