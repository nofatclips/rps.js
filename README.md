RockPaperScissors.js
======

Well, so I wanted to make my own JavaScript framework, but I also wanted it to be useful and unique: was there anything around that didn't have its won dedicated bunch of JavaScript frameworks already available? Is there a much needed gap to fill in the world of JS frameworks? Yes. Rock Paper Scissors!

You Gotta Be Kidding?

Yes, kind of. Anyway, here it is.

It's not finished, in fact it's not even actually working, and I think I'm going to change the API.

But feel free to fiddle around with the code as you like.
